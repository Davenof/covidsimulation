# covidsimulation
The model simulates the transmission and prevention of the coronavirus (COVID-19) among humans interfacing in a small community. The model basically shows how one COVID-positive person could transmit the virus to an entire community when preventive measures are not adhered to. The model also simulates how people who strictly follow recommended preventive measures could save themselves from contracting the disease. However, the only basis for prevention simulated in the model is social distance. Other factors influencing transmission and prevention, as well as recovery were not simulated.
